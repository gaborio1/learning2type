                Touch typing is the ability to type using all your fingers -
                ideally with correct finger placement - without looking at
                the keyboard.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have always thought that typing is an impressive and
                useful skill to have. Inspired by my mum and a good friend
                of mine, I finally decided to give it a go in 2019. As you
                would expect, it was a struggle initially. I was hoping that
                25 years of guitar playing would help with finger
                independence but it did not. I’d given up many times and
                started again in the first two years. Then I started to
                practice daily and I got noticeably better by the day. One
                thing that I would recommend you should do is to aim for
                100% accuracy, it will pay off in the long term. I got to
                know the basics with typing.com, did more advanced stuff
                using keybr.com and regularly tested my speed on
                tenfastfingers.com. You will find links to these sites on
                the links page.
                <br />
                <br />
                Learning2type.com is my own typing practice app that I
                designed and built in 2023 (still developing...), most
                features are based on other similar apps and I also
                implemented some of my own ideas. The most annoying thing to
                me is advertisements on websites...you won't see them on
                here and you don't need an ad blocker. Initially it was only
                a text input and a text field with no controls, timer or
                beginner level. I added all the features one by one, without
                having a clear idea what functionality and options/controls
                I wanted to implement next. I want to re-build this whole
                thing with React / Typescript at some point and make it a
                full stack app with user login and all that. Design wise,
                just trying to make it look the way I think is halfway
                decent, thats all…maybe I’ll get a designer involved to
                further improve the look and user experience. Going forward,
                the next step is to implement more features such as text
                editing keyboard shortcuts to delete the previous word or
                line to the left of the cursor.
